# Intro Management

I suppose what this file is intended to assist with is brainstorming how we deal with the user/guild/global level of everything.

- How do you upload a guild specific intro?

  - Tada prompts for you to pick after an upload, with options being 'private'(?), 'guild'(list to pick from) or 'global'(if admin?)
  - Tada/guild admin sets up a channel that tada reads for new intros.
  - Tada reads @tada msgs that have attachments for valid intros

- List-intros should always dm the asker

- Do admins need to be prompted with guilds to apply change to if they're admin in > 1 guild?

- List-intros should list private/per-guild/public intros

- Tada's management of intros actually needs to be implemented >.<

- Tada's ffmpeg validation checks of intros is important too.
